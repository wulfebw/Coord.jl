PolicyTable type contains all information needed to use a Qvalue table.

Description:
Use the policy table and belief state to calcualte the utilities of the possible joint actions

Parameters:
- policy_table: the policy table giving Q values
- belief: a sparse matrix of probabilities over states

Return Value:
- utilities: the utilities of the joint actions
    note that these utilities correspond to the joint actions
    based on their order.

Description:
When a coordination table is made from one policy it is created online in the following
section. If a coordination table is made from multiple polies, it is created offline as 
presented in offline_coordination_tables.jl. This section builds a coordination table using 
a q table and joint actions matrix. Does this by finding the optimal joint action for each row, 
and checking if the planes are turning in the same direction or opposite directions. 

Parameters:
- q_table: table of Q values shape (num_states, num_joint_actions)
- joint_actions: matrix where each row corresponds to a uav and each 
    column to a possible joint action

Return Value:
- returns the coordination table

    # allocate coordination table
    c_table = zeros(size(q_table, 1), 1)

    for ridx in 1:size(q_table, 1)
        utilities = q_table[ridx, :]

        # make it so that we do not select joint actions 
        # with straight or COC as one of the options

        end

        actions = joint_actions[:, aidx]

        # signal 1 for requiring same sense actions
        # note that we removed COC and straight above so 
        # does not come up here therefore case SAME includes:
        # right + right 
        # left + left
        if sign(actions[1]) == sign(actions[2])
            c_table_value = 1

        # otherwise, signal to only do opposite sense
        # therefore case DIFF includes:
        # right + left
        # left + right
